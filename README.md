# DersimizMatematik

This project is created for educational purposes. But later on I decided to keep it as an open source project.

- In this game; we have a child character that tries to get out from the school. But first he needs to unlock doors by typing correct passwords or by using correct keycards.

- Contributions are highly welcomed.
